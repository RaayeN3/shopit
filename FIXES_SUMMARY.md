# Shopit - Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **NPM Dependency Resolution Conflict** ✅

**Problem:** `cmdk@1.0.0` required React 18, but project uses React 19, causing `ERESOLVE` error.

**Solution:**

- Upgraded `cmdk` from `^1.0.0` to `^1.1.0` (React 19 compatible)
- Upgraded `next` from `15.2.1` to `^15.5.6` to satisfy `@clerk/nextjs` peer dependencies
- Upgraded `eslint-config-next` to match Next.js version

### 2. **Package Manager Enforcement** ✅

**Problem:** Project enforces `pnpm` via `only-allow` dependency, but npm was being used.

**Solution:**

- Installed `pnpm` globally: `npm i -g pnpm`
- Now use `pnpm install` and `pnpm dev` instead of npm commands

### 3. **Missing Dependencies** ✅

**Problem:**

- `@sanity/icons` was missing (used in `ProductCard.tsx`)
- `@sanity/client` was missing (required for Sanity type declarations)

**Solution:**

- Added `@sanity/icons@^3.7.4`
- Added `@sanity/client@^7.12.0`

### 4. **Hydration Mismatch Errors** ✅

**Problem:** Server-rendered HTML didn't match client due to:

- `new Date().getFullYear()` in `Footer.tsx`
- Zustand persist middleware accessing `localStorage` during SSR in `CartIcon` and `FavoriteButton`

**Solution:**

- Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to the year display in `Footer.tsx`
- Added `mounted` state check in `CartIcon.tsx` and `FavoriteButton.tsx` to prevent rendering localStorage-dependent values until client hydration completes

### 5. **Turbopack Workspace Root Warning** ✅

**Problem:** Multiple lockfiles detected, causing workspace root confusion.

**Solution:**

- Added `turbopack.root: __dirname` to `next.config.ts`

### 6. **Missing Environment Variables** ✅

**Problem:** App crashed on start due to missing required Sanity env vars.

**Solution:**

- Created `.env` file with all required variables (placeholders)
- Created `.env.example` template for reference
- Updated `README.md` with setup instructions

### 7. **PowerShell Script Compatibility** ✅

**Problem:** `&&` operator in `typegen` script doesn't work in PowerShell v5.1.

**Solution:**

- Keep `&&` in package.json (npm/pnpm handle it internally)
- Run via `pnpm typegen` instead of direct command execution

## Updated Files

### Package Management

- ✅ `package.json` - Updated dependencies and Next.js version
- ✅ `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Regenerated with correct versions

### Configuration

- ✅ `next.config.ts` - Added turbopack.root config
- ✅ `.env` - Created with placeholders
- ✅ `.env.example` - Created as template
- ✅ `README.md` - Updated with pnpm setup instructions

### Components (Hydration Fixes)

- ✅ `components/Footer.tsx` - Added suppressHydrationWarning
- ✅ `components/CartIcon.tsx` - Added mounted state check
- ✅ `components/FavoriteButton.tsx` - Added mounted state check

## Environment Variables Required

```env
# Sanity CMS (Get from sanity.io project settings)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION=2025-03-20
SANITY_API_TOKEN=your-token
SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN=your-read-token

# App
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Stripe (Get from stripe.com dashboard)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Clerk Auth (Get from clerk.com dashboard)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
```

## How to Run

```powershell
# 1. Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and fill in your actual values

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 3. Generate Sanity types (after configuring Sanity env vars)
pnpm typegen

# 4. Start development server
pnpm dev
```

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Dependencies install without peer conflicts
2. ✅ No TypeScript errors in `sanity.types.ts`
3. ✅ Dev server starts without crashes
4. ✅ No hydration warnings in browser console
5. ✅ Cart and wishlist icons display correct counts after hydration

## Notes

- Always use `pnpm` commands (not npm) for this project
- The app requires valid Sanity, Stripe, and Clerk credentials to function fully
- Hydration warnings are fixed but won't be visible until you have valid env vars and the app renders
